When we are pirates, nothing is more beautiful,
than a young girl, gold, jewels.
But should we still go to sea?
And risking our lives there?
Or just stay on earth?
And hide there in big hats?
Neither one nor the other, a little of both;
The world of Mana,
We will have to trim our spears,
Know how to push back what threatens us,
Because if one day you integrate the clan,
You will have to fight hurricanes,
And help those who are still only beginners.
