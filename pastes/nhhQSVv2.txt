[13:37:17] <dailykoder> ok why did the woman give me such a weird look just because i bought 3 times nail polish remover?
[13:38:54] <+socraticDev> because she thinks ur a pimp buying this for your hoes
[13:42:52] <@sugoi> why did u buy nail polish remover dailykoder 
[13:42:56] * @sugoi squints
[13:43:12] <dailykoder> sugoi, TONER TRANSFER ETCHING BRO
[13:43:44] <@sugoi> ah making drugs, I see
[13:43:51] <dailykoder> the acetone in nail polish remover is cleaner than the one i get get from my local diy store
[13:44:18] <dailykoder> and you cannot buy super clean acetone in germany anymore, if you got no license shit
[13:44:58] <dailykoder> But nail polish remover is probably the closest you can get. It just has some added perfume
[13:46:29] <dailykoder> sugoi, actually just making PCBs
